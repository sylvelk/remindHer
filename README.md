A quick "connected PostItÂ®" for helping elders

## Material need
- Small computer (RaspberryPi)
- Screen (TV, PC monitor, ...)
- Internet connection (Wifi, Ethernet, 3G, ...)

I personnally used a USB 3G stick, along with a prepaid data SIM in order to get a connection on the Raspberry. If you already have a wifi around, you can skip this step.
